# Movie-Recommendation-System

Recommendation systems use various filtering techniques to recommend movies to the user, such as 

1.Demographic filtering
2.Content-based filtering
3.Collaborative based filtering(SVD) and 
4.Hybrid filtering. 

These filtering techniques are based on the popularity, overview, metadata, user ratings. Cosine similarity is used to compute the similarity between the items to provide recommendations. By merging the strengths of both collaborative and content-based approaches and mitigating their weaknesses, the hybrid method gives a better approach for providing movie recommendations.
